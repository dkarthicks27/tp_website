            <p class="lead">The idea of TECH@PARK was not born in any boardroom discussions.
                We are not backed by any funding houses. We are a group of like-minded techies
                who commit our time and effort to give back to the society for a larger social
                cause. We do not have classrooms or paid instructors. But still, we have made a
                difference in the quality of talents we produce. Our results are different
                because our method itself is different.

                    <h3>Picking a Candidate</h3>
                    <p>We identify potential candidates through trusted sources ( i.e.
                        Colleagues/Ex-Students) who know their potential personally. We then
                        interview certain parameters to see if he has 'IT' in him.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Team Farming</h3>
                    <p>Students are expected to stay with the trainer. We encourage
                        them to farm as a team to learn the Engineering process. He will then be
                        involved in real-world projects which can either be Open Source projects or
                        from a potential hirer.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Pro-gramming</h3>
                    <p>Students are trained on the latest market trends &
                        technologies by industry experts. There is no predefined training duration
                        period. It goes on until he or the trainer feels 'COMPLETE'. While joining, our
                        students may not be the same. But they will achieve it when they 'COMP(L)ETE' </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Placement</h3>
                    <p>We reach out to companies that need relevant skill sets. As a
                        principle, we never recommend people. We just refer. When both the company and
                        student find themselves matching, then they pursue. Our student becomes ALUMNI
                        and a contributor in the course of action and stay connected with us ever
                        after, as our network grows stronger and wider:) </p>

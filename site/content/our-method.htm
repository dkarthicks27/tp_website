            <p class="lead">Idea of TECH@PARK was not born in boardroom discussion. We are not backed by any funding. We do not have classrooms or paid instructors. But still we have made a difrence in the quality of talents we produce. Our results are diffrent because our methods itself is different</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                    <h3>Picking a Candidate</h3>
                    <p>We identify potential candidates through trusted sources ( i.e. Colleagues/Ex-Students) 
                       who know their potentials personally. we then interview certain parameters to see if he has 
                       'IT' in him</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Team Farming</h3>
                    <p>Students are expected to stay with the trainer. We encourage them to farm as a team to learn 
                        Engineering process. he will then be involved in real world projects which can eigther be Open
                        Source or from a potential hirer.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Pro-gramming</h3>
                    <p>Students are trained on the latest market trends & technologies by industry experts. There is 
                    no predefined training duration period. It goes until he or the trainer feels 'COMPLETE'. While 
                    joining, our students may not be the same. But they should be when they 'COMP(L)ETE' </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Placement</h3>
                    <p>We reach out to companies that need relevant skill sets. As a principle, we never recommend
                     people we just refer to. When both the company and student find themselves matching. Our Student 
                     becomes ALUMNI :) </p>

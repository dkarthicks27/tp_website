Upgrade is usually considered optional in a working software. But they can cost heavily if not done ontime. (like what happened to those who sticked to java 8 even after java 19). For Spring Boot users, one of the major upgrade is from Spring Boot 2 to 3. One needs clear understanding and plan to make this without (much of) a mess. I will cover the lesons i learned during upgrading a live application to Spring boot 3.

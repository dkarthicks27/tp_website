Storage data security refers to the measures and techniques used to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction while in storage.

components of storage data security:

1. Crypytography
2. Access control
3. Backup and disaster recovery
4. Firewall and intrusion detection
5. Physical security
6. Compliance
7. Data De-identification
8. Data Governance

Crypytography is used to protect your sensitive data using one of the below

Pseudonymized
Anonymized
Generalized

Overall, storage data security is a critical component of protecting sensitive information, and organizations should implement a comprehensive security strategy that includes all of these components. Regularly monitoring, testing and updating the security measures will help to ensure that data is kept secure.

Data Deidentify - Identify

**Data identification:**

Data identification refers to the process of identifying unique data elements within a dataset. This can include adding unique identifiers, creating digital signatures, and comparing data elements to reference datasets. The goal of data identification is to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data, and to make it easy to retrieve and manage specific data elements.

methods of identifying data:

1. Data tagging
2. Data fingerprinting
3. Data hashing
4. Data matching
5. Data validation

Data identification can also be used to detect data breaches and data leakages, and as an element of compliance, like in GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations. This can help organizations to take steps to protect sensitive information and to prevent data breaches from occurring.

**Data de-identification:**

Data de-identification, on the other hand, is the process of removing or obscuring personal identifying information from a dataset, making it less likely to be used to identify an individual. The goal of data de-identification is to protect the privacy of individuals while still allowing the data to be used for research or other purposes. This can be done by replacing sensitive information with symbols, adding random noise, grouping data together, creating synthetic data or removing all direct and indirect identifiers.

methods of de-identifying data:

1. Masking
2. Perturbation 
3. Aggregation 
4. Synthetic data
5. Anonymization

It is important to note that de-identifying data is not foolproof and there is always a risk of re-identification. Therefore, it's important to continuously monitor the data and to use multiple methods of de-identification to reduce the risk of re-identification.

In addition to these methods, there are also several standards and frameworks that organizations can use to ensure that their data de-identification practices are effective. These include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) de-identification standard, the Safe Harbor Method, and the Statistical De-identification Method.

Overall, data de-identification is a critical aspect of data privacy, and organizations should take the necessary steps to ensure that personal identifying information is removed or obscured in a way that effectively protects the privacy of individuals.
